      <h2 class="heading">The Problem</h2>
      <p>The problem we seek is that many people drink contaminated water unknowingly. They are not able to check whether the water is suitable for drinking (pure or not) on their own at their homes in a very easy and economical way. This leads to people suffering from various kinds of diseases due to consumption of contaminated water like cholera, typhoid, diarrhoea, dysentery etc. Water testing labs are available to verify the water purity at the source. But such labs are in a limited number. Water should also be verified on the go at the distribution point (taps, showers, faucets etc.) for which a small device is needed.</p>
